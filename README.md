## Restaurant Online Menu System

This project that I coded through Eclipse is my first project.

With the project, customers can create their orders and at the same time see the amount they have to pay; A system has been designed where authorized users can obtain and manage information about the restaurant and its employees (for example; food stocks in the restaurant kitchen, money in the main cash register or employee work schedules, etc.). </br>
English presentation with planning the project, drawing the UML activity diagram and writing the codes using java software language
has been made.

This work, in which I also acted as the spokesperson of the project, is a team work consisting of 4 people.

While you can access the codes from the "RestaurantMenuSystem" file, you can find the project report I uploaded above.
